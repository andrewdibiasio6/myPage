        "I’ll tell you the story of Jimmy Jet— And you know what I tell you is true. He loved to watch his TV setAlmost as much as you."
      ],
      [
        "He watched all day, he watched all night Till he grew pale and lean, From “The Early Show” to “The Late Late Show” And all the shows between."
      ],
      [
        "He watched till his eyes were frozen wide, And his bottom grew into his chair. And his chin turned into a tuning dial, And antennae grew from his hair."
      ],
      [
	  "And his brains turned into TV tubes, And his face to a TV screen. And two knobs saying “VERT.” and “HORIZ.” Grew where his ears had been."
	  ],
	  [
	  "And he grew a plug that looked like a tail So we plugged in little Jim. And now instead of him watching TV We all sit around and watch him."
